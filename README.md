Hey there

Well when I started my journey with Java in August in 2024
I decided to get questions from leetcode and other
sources and use them for practice.

And as to that i decided to make a repository on github as this
would always remind me to do a practice question in java and also
make commits everyday.

So this is continously helps me get better  with the commands and also makes me  a better developer in java.

I thought of making the repository public so that if any one gets to be at the start up point like i was at in the beginning, they can be inspired.
